    "1. Errors such as user input may arise due to corner cases one could not plan for, there could be compilation errors or errors with the code running due to weird calculations\n",
    "2. One should always use corner cases and broad cases. Broader cases that you can easily calculate are good for preliminary testing, and the corner cases for more in-depth testing\n",
    "3. I encountered an error going out of index many times. Often this was just a misfire with pythons ``range`` function\n",
    "4. Single tests are corner cases such as loading up a blank sheet without a name, closing the tab without saving, or other corner cases."
