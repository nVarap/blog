1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- Signing into various places, asking for information in our project, and having to provide necessary information when say running commands in shell such as `sudo`. Biometric information inputted at various accounts
2. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?
- Facially, I only have one video on youtube from 5th grade. However I feel that my data has still been exposed regardless, as a result of data trackers, cookies, digital footprint, etc. In some way, shape or form, I most likely have my entire profile of myself out on the internet, along with my interests. I find this rather disturbing, as this can lead to be almost incredibly targeted and slightly privacy-infringing ads. 
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
- Good passwords use a variety of symbols, not just ASCII symbols, and have it rather long. Bad passwords can be too long, use simple and easy to guess words, and lack variation. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is 2fa, or two factor authentication. This provides a secondary form of authentication exclusive from the primary form, allowing for complete authentication
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
- Symmetric encryption is where, when passwords are being passed, the hashing and rehashing of information using the same algorithm. However, in asymmetric encryption, the hashing of the information is done via a series of different keys, different algorithms are used to hash them. This also means in symmetric encryption, you have to keep the same key secret.
5. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.
- AWS deployment often uses server-side AES 256 encryption for information, and hashes information to-and-fro when routing requests. Thus, information is kept secure.
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
- I have not learned about phishing schemes the hard way, but one weird site was a site that automatically downloaded some items to my computer when I was young. I was very scared at the time and have always thought about that when surfing. Some phishing techniques include scams from friends, scams from providers who ma not have the same, email, etc.
