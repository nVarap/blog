# Video 1.3 pt 1 
- A program development starts with an idea
- Programmed with a purpose
- Devs follow specific steps
    - sometimes planned
    - sometimes based off of results
-  Devs investigate and reflect
- Developers must:
    - Determine the requirements of the project
    - Determine the constraint
        - options, time, etc
    - understand user concerns and interests
- How to investigate
    - surveys
    - user testing
    - interviews
    - direct observations
- Certain investigative techniques offer different pros
- Developers design after investigating
- Steps
    - Brainstorming
    - Storyboard the program
    - Plan user experience
    - Laying out UI
    - Organize into modules
    - prep a testing strat
- Check requirements
    - Describe how it behaves
    - Describe a list of user interactions
    - Devs create a prototype of the program
        - an incremental process is used to test each module in the program
- Testing occurs at the micro and macro level

- ***CITE YOUR SOURCES***
- Programming is rarely solo
- individuals work on different parts of the project   
    - ***CITE YOUR SOURCES***
- Credit people in the documentation of the program
    - Even if they look at it, not actually code
- Use commends to credit
- Programs are developed with code segments, procedures and algorithms from other people
    - Similar to quoting
    - Give them credit
    - Algorithms are considered *intellectual property*
- Say *X* people did *X* thing
- ***CITE YOUR SOURCES***

- Write commentsWrite commentsWrite commentsWrite commentsWrite commentsWrite commentsWrite comments
 - Programming documentation describes what the program does
    - what specific fucntions/emthods/code segrments do
    - List events and correspondents
- When?
    - Before: specifications
    - During: to keep track of progress
    - After: to explain the overall process
    - Improves efficiency
    - Improves testing and refining
    - Improves bug responses
- How
    - Comments
        - i.e `#` or `//` or `/` or `'''` or `<!---->`
    - Comments do not affect how the program runs
    - Various schemes
