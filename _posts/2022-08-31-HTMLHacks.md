## Trying to change my theme

Changing my theme wasn't too tough, and I changed my theme to `hacker`. While I enjoyed the hacker theme (image below), it didn't have the pages that I typically used. Image formatting was also bad and really only seemed useful if there were no pictures. 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chakerrr.png "Hacker Theme")

Apart from different pages not being available, clicking on items leads to weird notation. I feel that hacker would be much better for bullet points as opposed to actual paragraphs.
