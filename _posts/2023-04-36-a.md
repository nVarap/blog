# Hack 1

Pros of Duck DNS:

- Its free, and allows you to access domain services that allow users to assign a domain name specific to their website.
- Access a device using a specific host name. Convenient as opposed to a port or other host name
- Can use HTTPS or other form of hashing algorithm in order to protect data
- Domain names can be custom in order to make stuff more accessible
  
Cons of Duck DNS:
- Not suitable for larger projects, or maybe unable to be scaled.
- Depends on the connection of the device to the domain service, no direct connection in a way like ethernet or other form of connection

# Hacks 2

We use a DNS in order to host our flask projects on a local server in order to make sure that those who are on the internet can access our flask pages. DuckDNS takes our flask and hosts it on a local server stored in a server room elsewhere int eh world, sharing our information from our device and our AWS container to that server which attaches our hosted version to a different port, under a different name, thus allowing it to be hosted. To setup using duck DNS, we have to (1) Sign in with your DuckDNS account by selecting “Sign in with Github” (2) Then create a subdomain using (3) Change the IP address to the one you would like to link to(4) Click the IP address button and link to your subdomain.

# Hack 3 (Not doing)

# Hack 4

I do not currently have any confusions regarding deployment. I found the process rather intuitive, and really the commands to be the primary issues. Mainly outdated and conflicting dependencies as a result of there being numerous people on the same instance. Also, there are some issues with the number of internet connections that need to occur in order to reach,a dn there are also issues with the idea of PUSD internet interfering with the process. Many of the issues we see really do happen because there aren't necessarily fixes we see online. These are extreme corner cases that we come upon by sheer coincidence.

# KASM Hacks
Virtual desktops and KASM (Kernel Adaptive Security Module) provide a secure environment to access data without compromising the host's system. In an APCSP, we can use KASM to create a controlled environment with which students can contribute to code without suffering the consequences. Additionally, virtual desktops can be useful for facilitating collaboration among students and enabling remote instruction. VNCs could be used for cross-platform or long-distance collaboration, as we see with splashtop in the CTE department.

# Certbot hacks

## Certbot Hacks 1:
I could not install the Certbot package, and thus was unable to get a screenshot of Certbot working

## Certbot Hacks 2:

OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of SSL/TLS protocols that is widely used for secure communication on the Internet. It offers a range of cryptographic features, including encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and hash functions. 
LibreSSL, on the other hand, is a fork of OpenSSL that was created in 2014 after the discovery of the Heartbleed vulnerability. In terms of security features, both OpenSSL and LibreSSL offer similar capabilities, such as support for strong cryptographic algorithms, certificate validation, and secure key management. 
In March 2021, OpenSSL released a security advisory that addressed three vulnerabilities, including a high-severity flaw that could allow an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack or execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
