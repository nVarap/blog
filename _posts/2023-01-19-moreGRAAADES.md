## Video/Review 1

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Correctly displays the purpose, input, and output. | 1. Meets all of the criteria| 
| Data Abstraction | 0. List is given, data accessed is not | 0. meets 2/3 criteria| 
| Managing Complexity | 0. Does not display how complexity is managed. Does not display how complexity is shown. No code segment is shown either | 0. Meets 0/2 criteria|
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Correctly shows implementation. | 1. Meets all of the criteria |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. Shows implementation of algorithm | 1. Clears all of the criteria |

**Reflect**: I found this to have the necessary stuff except for the implementation of algorithms functions. I see very clearly what could be changed.

# Video Revision 2

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Provides a complete description of  | 1. Meets all the criteria | 
| Data Abstraction | 1. Provides a complete description of data storage and accessing. | 1. Meets all the criteria. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1. Shows how lists manage complexity. | 1. Meets all the criteria |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Correctly shows correct function implementation and the development of the procedure and usage | 1. Meets all of the criteria |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. Describes the usage and development of an algorithm  | 1. Meets all of the criteria |

**Reflect**: This is a perfect example of a great performance task, with in-depth answers and the correct information to boot.

# Video Revision 3

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Provides a complete description of  | 1. Meets all the criteria | 
| Data Abstraction | 0. No distinct segment provided | 0. Does not show utilization of the data in the list. | 
| Managing Complexity | 0. Generalized and not specific. | 0. Very unspecific and generalized purpose. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0. No parameter for the function  | 0. No parameter |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0. Describes the wrong type of calls, doesn't describe the parameter. Doesn't describe results, but what appears on the screen. | 0. Misses all the criteria |

**Reflect**: This example is an example of what not to do, and it doesn't really answer the questions effectively. Talks about being specific and acknowledging what we have to do.

# Video Revision 4

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Shows input/output and the purpose of the game.  | 1. Meets all the criteria | 
| Data Abstraction | 1. Defines what is being stored and what exists | 1. Meets all the criteria, provides the data being accessed and what is being stored. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1. Shows how complexity is managed through using the list to represent each time. | 1. Talks about storing and the data. Shows how the code can be written without lists |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Talks about the procedure and parameters.  | 1. Describes a procedure and its functionality. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0. Doesn't indicate the arguments, doesn't indicate the conditions tested. | 0. Misses all the criteria |

**Reflect**: A great example of coding, but not much to talk about related to algorithmic usage. Something to talk about.
