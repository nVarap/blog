## Video/Review 1

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 0. The responses are not nearly specific enough to warrant a point. | 0. This only meets three of the 6 criteria.| 
| Data Abstraction | 0. This list given is not described, and we don't know what the list contributes to the code overall| 0. Only the code segments provided, nothing about the description. Meets 1/6 criteria| 
| Managing Complexity | 0. Does not display how complexity is managed. Does not display how complexity is shown. No code segment is shown either | 0. Meets 0/2 criteria|
| Procedural Abstraction | 0. does not describe how the program uses it and how it improves functionality. | 0. Minimal description|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly displays running the code and how the algorithm is implemented | 1. Correctly displays running |

**Reflect**: I found this to be the first truly *bad* example of what not to do. I'd probably have to take more time to write the performance task and ensure that I am as detailed as possible. If possible, maybe use language of the prompt?

## Video/Review 2

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Correctly displays what it is solving and what it is looking to do. Purpose properly stated | 1. Displays purpose and what is necessary. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1. Shows how this contributes to managing the complexity of the program, and how its complexity would allow for logical sense| 1. Follows all of the points collegeboard requires| 
| Managing Complexity | 1. Displays how the complexity is managed through a variety of functions| 0. Meets all the criteria, correctly explains why|
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Describes the usage of the program well, and how it can be used. | 1. Well written paragraphs describing the usage.|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly displays running the code and how the algorithm is implemented | 1. Correctly displays running the code, multiple times both in the video and in the written |

**Reflect**: This is an awesome, student-made example. Something like this (as the program states) builds creativity within me.

## Video/Review 3

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Displays all the necessary criteria and how each is met both in the response and in the video. | 0. Meets 5/6 requirements, as it describes the function and not the purpose| 
| Data Abstraction | 1. Correctly displays elements in a list and how each is processed| 1. Follows all of the points collegeboard requires| 
| Managing Complexity | 1. Displays how the complexity is managed through a variety of functions| 1. Meets all the criteria, correctly explains why |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Describes the usage of the program well, and how it can be used. | 1. Well written paragraphs describing the usage.|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly displays running the code and how the algorithm is implemented, especially shown in the video | 1. Correctly displays running the code, multiple times both in the video and in the written |

**Reflect**: Its really the written response that is necessary to getting all the points. 

## Video/Review 4

| Section | My Grade (1 or 0) | CB Grade/Explain
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Correctly displays overall purpose and funciton. | 1. Meets all the reqs| 
| Data Abstraction | 0. Does not completely describe the abstraction of data | 0. Similar to what I said. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1. Meets both criteria, shows how the student-developed procedure and its functionality | 1. Meets both criteria |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Explains how the function works and its functionality | 1. Explains functionality and how the algorithm works in detail|
| Algorithm Implementation | 0. Does not meet all the criteria, missing out on specific criteria | 0. Doesn't meet all the criteria. |

**Reflect**: Its really the written response that is necessary to getting all the points, I definitely need to ensure that my performance task includes a great written response.
