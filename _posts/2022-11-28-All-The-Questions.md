### My own questions
**You are a school who wants to iterate over a bunch of student IDs (which are in the order such that if you added one, you would get the next student) to contact them, what variable name/data type would you use**

1. ID, integer
2. stuID, integer
3. studentID, string
4. IDofStudentNumber, integer

    1. ID is descriptive enough, especially if iterating. Also, if you are iterating it is inefficient to iterate over a string of multiple numbers, so adding would actually be the most efficient method.
</details>

**You want to store the grade of you and your friend. What would you call your score and what datatype?**

1. score, integer
2. My score, integer
3. myScore, float
4. myScore, integer

    3. Floats are the way to store decimal types, such as grades. myScore is a name that is descriptive enough, since you have to differ between two scores. 
</details>

**You want store a name over a interation. What would you call your variable and what data type**

1. name, string
2. name, integer
3. myName, string
4. lmao_get_rekt, integer
    
<details closed>
<summary>Click for the answer!</summary>
    1. you want to store an arbitrary name, not a regular one, so you'll use a generic name. This is a name, so you'd use a string.
</details>
