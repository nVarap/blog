Grades on :

| Section | Grade/Explanation |
| ------- | ----- |
| 9 & 11  | 0.9, as I did all was asked and no extras, I deserved this score. I probably should have done extras for this though, event though I did code the actual algorithm I understand how that isn't extra |
| 13.2-13.3 | 1.0, as I finished all that was asked for and created my own robot course, goal, and way to get through it using procedural abstraction. I'm happy with my score. |

Overall reflection : I'm happy with my scores, but I'm going to start moving towards actually doing extra in order to get 1.0s.
