## Pseudocode
`PROCEDURE buildRandomWord()`
> Out of a provided list, generate a random word

> Create a new string, the same length as the generated word, with each character `*`

> Return a list of [generated word, hidden word]

`PROCEDURE returnWhere(letter, word)`
> iterate through the non-hidden word

> check to see if it equals the letter

> if so, add the index to a list

> if not, continue

> return the list of indexes

`PROCEDURE replaceAt(letter, list, word_to_guess)`
> check to see if the list.length is > 0

> if so, continue on

> if not, show a label  **none** and increment guesses by 1

> otherwise, at the corresponding indexes, replace the character with the letter

`show the starting page, allow the user to click the play button`
`when play button is clicked:`
> Unhide the submit button

> Unhide the text entry 

> Unhide the display label

`allow the user to enter in a character and submit it with the submit button`
`use returnWhere`
`use replaceAt`
`increment total guesses`
`increment regular guesses if the list returned by returnWhere is empty`
`Display the guesses in the label by the gallows`
`Display the updated hidden word`

`IF guesses = 6, display the screen that tells the player they lost`
`IF the hidden word and the regular word match, display the screen that tells the player they won and in how many guesses`

## Matching up with the rubric

1. Program purpose and function
- The program has a clear purpose; a game of hangman
- The program's function is to receive an input as a letter and output a string of the letter informing the player on what letters they may have gotten correct
- It takes input from the player in the form of a character and outputs the new string
- The program functions wells and is consistent

2. Data Abstraction
- The program abstracts data into lists, i.e
    - The list of words to choose from
    - The index list holding where the letters are correct
    - The list containing the correct and hidden word

3. Managing Complexity
- To manage repeatable or complex tasks, I grouped them into functions, i.e
    - The function to check correctness
    - The function to check for the indexes at which letters are correct
    - The function to replace the letters at said indexes
- These tasks repeat often in a game of hangman to condensing them into functions reduces the time needed to not only compile but to code. If this game were to expand it would also allows for reusable usage of these functions.

4. Procedural Abstraction
- The functions created are adaptable and have very little hard coding
- In a different environment, these functions can adapts
- The replace at function at replace different characters given a list
- The returnWhere function can be used out of this context to find indices at which letters match up

5. Algorithm Implementation
- This program implements an accurate algorithm, which takes in input, checks said input, and outputs proper feedback
    - Takes in a character
    - Loops over characters, finding indices 
    - Replaces letters at said indices
    - Outputs new string
- This algorithm continues until the program terminates or the player succeeds/fails

6. Testing
- Strenuous testing was undertaken with this program
- Built to be consistent and resilient
- All undertaken by me

### Tips to improve:

- Add ***comments***
- Code everything at once, then look at the rubric.


## Reflection on the article

Thanks to reading the article, I now know the proper procedure and tactics on how I can get a 5 on the APCSP exam in May. To be specific, I now know what tools are available, such as Khan Academy and where I can find practice tests. I now know what college board looks for when they grade projects. I now know to add comments more often, something that I can often neglect. As shown above, I've listed items I could improve upon to make sure I attain a 5. While I still have a way to go, I believe I am on the right track.
