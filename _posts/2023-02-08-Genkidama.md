# Blog Reflection

1. VWhen you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. <br>
- Apache License
    - Preservation of copywrite regulations. Allows for modification
- GNU License(s)
    - Make source code almost completely available to all. Allow for various distribution mention. Many different types
- Mozilla Public License
    - Large distribution and professional presence using this license. Useful for patents
- MIT License 
    - Simpler license, allows for availability of the source code, creates modifiable and distributable code
- Boost Software License
    - Allows for distribution without source code. licensed work and modifications allowed.
- The Unlicense 
    - Dedicates work to the public space, allows for complete puclic domain use
- Creative commons!
    - Allows for various modifications as allowed by the terms of the license
    - I only wanted to talk about this because of Dungeons and Dragons `:))`

2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.
- We mainly talked about how ethically, stealing data or DMCA and copyright abuse plague the internet space. I especially believe that data brokers, who take information via legal methods i.e cookies and sell this info for tuppence, are unethical, even though their practices are legal and available to any kind of person of business. From political to past abusers, anyone with a couple 100 dollars can track anyone down to their address. I feel that it is necessary to be cautious of your data, but it must be accepted that it is an inevitability, not a choice, to have your info out on the net. 
3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.
- We applied the MIT license to both the frontend and the backend of our CPT project. We did this because we believe that the MIT license is by far the best in terms of tradeoffs. I will not be using my CPT project for my actual CPT, and I believe that anyone is welcome to modify the code we have (I also believe that anyone who choses to do that is insane but it's their decisions they have to contemplate). Thusly, I believe that the MIT license is by far the greatest for us to use.
