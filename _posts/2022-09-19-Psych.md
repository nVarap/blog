# Video Notes and Vocab
- Enterprise: A project that is difficult/requires effort
    - Enterprise can always be improved, we can improve where we're at
- Our life circumstances don't matter as much **as we think**. Many different people (i.e those who've won the lottery)
- Intuitions: We can understand things without conscious reasoning
- Taking care of happiness doesn't work without putting practices to work
- **G.I Joe** fantasy: Simply knowing about a bias is enough to put the idea into practice
- Often, the mind mugs up about what it means to be happy. It often lies.
    - One case: Salary and our jobs
    - Money
    - Amount money needed to not up your happiness is around $70k
- Very happy people make time for social connections. 
    - Connecting with humans helps happiness
- Helping others helps us a lot, and helps us be happy more
- Thinking about what we are grateful about is very powerful
    - Expressing gratitude is a very good
- Sleeping is good
- Remaining in the present moment is often the best thing
- Savoring the moment is often better
- Affluence: The state of having a great deal of money (wealth)
- Be affluent in time (spending money)
- Happy people prioritize their time over their money

**Reflections**: I often feel that I participate in some of these insights. I really like to help and remain in social contact with people, however I do not feel that I go out of my way to remain in contact. I also am not time affluent at all. This is sad because it doesn't allow for me to be as happy as I'd like, so I feel that after watching this video I will be looking to focus more on my the time I have off (maybe giving myself an hour to myself, similarly to the Yale students)
