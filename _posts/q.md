I took MCQ test 4. I got one question wrong out of the entire test.

**Incorrect Questions:**
None! I got nothing wrong. I found a majority of the non-code questions to be quite easy, so I know I have to mainly prepare for the code segments, and mainly the robot sections, as those can be pretty hard without paper.

Reflection: 

I'm very proud of My 66/66 on the test, and I feel that my work in this class has paid off towards preparing for the AP test.

As I reviewed the test questions, I realized that the code sections were the sections I struggled ont he most. I recognize that I need to spend more time studying these areas to ensure that I have a solid understanding of them. I plan to review robot and code segment problems in order to compensate for this.

One find that I need to recall to my notes less often. I found that the vocab made sense and the code also seemed to make more sense as well. This confirmed to me that I have a strong understanding of the material

Overall, I'm very proud of my score and pleased with my performance on the test. I know that I have some areas to work on, but I'm confident that with continued effort and practice, I can get 100% again.
