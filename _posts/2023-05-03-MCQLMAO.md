I did very well on my 2020 MCQ, getting a X/67 on it.

Some problems I got wrong were:
- Question 17
  - I got this wrong because I misclicked I shouldn't have misclicked to do 1 only instead of 1, 2, 3
- Question 26
  - I got this wrong because I did not notice that the binary nature would have resulted in not being able to store multiple values.
- Question 64
  - I forgot to select 2 answers, so I only selected one of the two correct answers
- Question 67
  - I did not notice that adding in maple would result in issues with the selection statement. Also with the loop resulting in issues setting count to 0.
