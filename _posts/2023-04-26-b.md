**SASS**
SASS allows for greater variable storage of colors and various different styles. They are also far more compatible with various different ideas. 

**Advanced**
The `@keyframes` tag allows for us to store and recognize a set of keyframes. This is used in combination of the animation property. Fade class could be used to help run these animations as well.

**Number Guessing Game**
It works by checking a number guessed in order to see if it is higher or lower, and then setting a text marker to be as such. Then, it will change color of the background depending on whether the answer is correct or incorrect

SASS makes this more appealing by adding color, so it isn't just black-and-white
