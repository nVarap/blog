## Project at N@TM
- At the actual event, our AWS died literally beforehand, and we were unable to get it to work as a result (due to an exit code 3)
- With hindsight, it was due to a problem in the code so the AWS interpreter couldn't compile it. Good to note in future cases that an exit code of 3 means there is an error in the source code
- Our presentation went well, I feel. 

## Other projects
- I liked seeing 3D animation stuff, because I was in the class last year and found it interesting. Mainly I liked the model of a person someone did. 
- I really liked ceramics, especially because they had a ceramic fruit from *One Piece*, and anime I really like
- For CSP, I saw the lawnmowers, who created multiple games on fastpages.
