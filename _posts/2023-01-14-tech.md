# Ideating Technical Details
**TASK**: Upon the tasks that which you ideated last week, ensure that you have technical details upon which you can execute in order to ensure that your ideas work.

## Task 1: Constructor/Constructor Championship Quiz
1. Build the list
    - Get raw data from github images. form into a list of various lists
    - Generate a function that can get a random element from the list
        - retrieve one link *&* its answer
        - return the image generated + extra information if necessary
    - With the image, place it and store the answer
        - Probably means dictionary is necessary
    - allow the user to input something
    - <input placeholder="Something Like this" id="input"> 
    - <button onclick="printTextIfRight()"> Button also included for work </button>
    - <p id="ret"> the answer would then be considered whether it was true </p>
    - Running on this basic system switch out questions depending on whether it was correct or not. (Also save strikes if incorrect)
    - **<mark> After the game </mark>**:  Save into a file/api? allow to save and display a highscore for those who wish to save as such. Gives as an incentive to continue.
