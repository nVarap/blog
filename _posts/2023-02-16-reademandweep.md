# Night At the Museum
This trimester, Night at the Museum was really fun! I had fun looking at different projects, and introducing our project to others. Even though a lot of our features were work in progress, seeing other people's projects work really well was awesome.

# Various Other Projects

1. Arcade
- Chinmay and Emaad had an arcade that had multiple different games, such as a country guesser and a hangman game. This arcade had numerous different features and I believed they stored various information in a backend

2. Recipe Machine
- Colin, Keira, and Shreyas all had a food-esque website which could display various recipes and the locations of various different ethnic cuisines in the area. I found their project to be cool due to the scaling, and I noticed how their project could allow users to implement their own recipes, which used some crowdsourcing tactics

3. Furry Friend Finder
- Hae Ryn and her group created a way to track dogs, adopt, recommend, and journal about a dog you may have. I am a dog person (however I can't have one cause a family member of mine is allergic), so I did like the various features. Their frontend and backend connection was seamless and I really liked how each feature built off one another.

4. Cat Cafe
- Drew and Tanisha had a cat café website, a website for a café that has cats. There you could schedule events, see events, and rate the restaurant. The projects has a very well constructed frontend and a great interaction between frontend and backend. 

5. Formula One Database
- Krish made a formula one database that could set events and record events into a database. It was very cool to look at and I liked the frontend.

# Reflection
I met a ton of my friends and even new people when I looked at various projects. These projects were super cool even though many of them (including our own) were not finished. I'd have really liked if tri 2 could have moved around some breaks to accommodate completed projects, because that would make N@TM so much more entertaining. Pertaining to other classes, I was surprised and disappointed not to see any business materials from Mr.Buxton, as he and his classes are some of my favorite on campus. I overall believe that the day would have been better if we had a bit more done, but overall, it was a fine day. 7/10. 
ps: Jazz band was great!
