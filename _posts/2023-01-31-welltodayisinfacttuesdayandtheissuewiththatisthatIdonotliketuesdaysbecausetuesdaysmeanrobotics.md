# Answers to Questions
**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?** <br>
Computer science allows crowdsourced ideas such as allowing for crowdsourced teacher reviews. Crowdsourcing is delegating many smaller tasks to a crowd for payment or as volunteers. We can better our community by crowdsourcing feedback in a multi-step feedback process. By nominating specific issues we find in a community or lesson plan (this prevents direct animosity to show through towards teachers), we can talk about the issues we see in our community, and lead us cumulatively to a greater community. This could be initiated through text messages and on-campus marketing. <br>
Another crowdsourcing initiative we could have is a wiki for newer CompSci students of various grades. As high schoolers we may seem very scary for younger children, and as a result if we are able to crowdsource a "survival guide" for younger children in various grades who are interested in CompSci, we can alleviate the stress that may cause for others around us. This would be crowdsourcing as we could have various sections filled out by separate people as volunteers (this being many micro-tasks fulfilled by the community). We could implement this similarly to the previous idea: through differing methods such as releasing the wiki secretly, and then advertising it. Should we introduce it mysteriously, we could also drive more interest. <br>

Through these two ideas, we can find good ways to utilize the specialties of CompSci students for crowdsourced ideas. 

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?** <br>
First, to answer the obvious. If crowdsourcing in this context means joining the dating app that we create, and reporting bad actors, our final project *would* be much better with crowdsourcing. <mark>However</mark>, if this is pertaining to the actual creation and collaboration upon... maybe not. A lot of people working with different perspectives may not be the most efficient way to develop a dating app. <br>
Using Del Norte for a similar "survival guide" would be very useful, this way instead of simply helping APCSP students, we could also help those in younger grades, and help with various things such as college and internship admissions. People who want to chase these things but don't have the necessary commitment/connections may falter in this case, but with something similar to this, we'd definitely be able to utilize the various expertises of kids at Del Norte. <br>

Another idea we could implement using Del Norte Students would be raising community awareness. A page where we could have various people enter various issues they see within the community, and then allowing a platform for those people to arrange for such communal activities to occur would be a great help to the community and better us as a whole. Basically, the community can build a platform for themselves through something like. <br>

Through ideas such as this, wwe can utilize not only the expertise, but also the experiences of Del Norte students to ensure that we can better our community.
