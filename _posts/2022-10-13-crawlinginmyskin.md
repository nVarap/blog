# 4.1 Notes Pt 1
- Computers used to be very large
    - Computers started miniaturizing 
- Computers needed to communicate with one another
- Computers send packets of one another
    - Includes source and destinations
    - Sent Via Computer System
- Words sent
    - Words are sent in packets, converted to bytes, and sent
    - don't need to be sent in orders, can have different routes
- Routers help find paths (allow packets to jump)
- Bandwidth limits. 

Vocab:
**Path**: A sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver
**Route**: The process of finding a path from sender to receiver. 
**Computer System**: A group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.
**Computer Device**: A physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
**Bandwidth**: The maximum of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.
**Computer Network**: A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.

# 4.1 Notes Pt 2
- A **protocol** are the rules that dictate how packets move
- 2 types
    - OSI: Go through 7 layers in order to communicate
    - TCP: Transmission control protocol --> explains how they interact
- Internet Engineering Task Force: Manages standards and technical info concerning info over the open and collaborative process
- There are steps (layers)
- Network Access
    - Most common is ethernet, which uses Network Interface Card
    - This allows our computer to hop between
    - everything has a mac number
- Internet Layer
    - This is where they convert into metadata
    - You get an IP, sender and receiver
- Transport
    - Opens protocol and certifies, sometimes you don't
    - transports
- IP Addresses
    - We send IPs to different or a lot of people
- Domain addresses allow us to set certain IPs to certain real-world names
