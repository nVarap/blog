# Reflection
I got a 45/50 on the tri 2 final, a perfect 90%. This means I got 0.9 on the final

# Question 21
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q21.png "A goose of mine")
**My Answer:** A <br>
**Correct Answer:** C <br>
**Explanation:** I got this wrong because  I wasn't aware of how an error would form. It looked to run correctly, but looking at it right now I do see the error. I also should have noted that we probably need more cases to truly test if the code would work.

## Question 28
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q28.png "A goose of mine")

**My Answer:** D <br>
**Correct Answer:** A&C <br>
**Explanation:** I got this wrong because I didn't understand what was occurring very well. I didn't understand how substring worked, and probably should have looked that up to understand how it worked. I also did not note that the second variable was necessary, believing it was.

# Question 40
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q40.png "A goose of mine")

**My Answer:** A <br>
**Correct Answer:** B <br>
**Explanation:** Mainly because I did not understand the directions that it would turn. I neglected the fast that the course is a completely mirrored. Thus no change is necessary.

# Question 41
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q41.png "A goose of mine")

**My Answer:** A <br>
**Correct Answer:** B <br>
**Explanation:** Honestly this was me being very dumb, I was thinking at first that it had to be sorted, but thought that a computer-based algorithm may not know how to work on binary (neglecting that's basically how all computers run). this was a real screw up on my part

# Question 50
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q50.png "A goose of mine")

**My Answer:** D <br>
**Correct Answer:** A&C <br>
**Explanation:** I got this one wrong because I flat out forgot what reasonable timings for algorithms were, and neglected to check online to see if I was correct. Regardless, I now know why I was wrong, as I see which algorithms run on factorial and exponential growth, which are not a reasonable time frame.

# Reflection:
For a certain amount of time, I looked online to answer some of the questions I did not understand, but later I chose not to, to test myself. I eventually got a lot more than I thought I did, however I could have gotten a much larger score if I was more careful. For the future, I plan to change my style when it comes to taking these test, focusing more on my personal growth (minimizing the time I look online for answers).
