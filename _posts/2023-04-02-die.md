**Score 49/50**


Question 49:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q49.png "Fuck off")

My answer: C

Correct Answer: A

Why I got it Wrong: Because I forgot to see that the index began at two, and thus skipped over a crucial element of the list

Reflection: 

I'm very proud of My 49/50 on the test, and I feel that my work in this class has paid off towards preparing for the AP test.

As I reviewed the test questions, I realized that there were some topics that I didn't fully grasp, and these were the questions I struggled with the most. I recognize that I need to spend more time studying these areas to ensure that I have a solid understanding of them. I plan to review the material again and practice more challenging problems in these areas.

One thing that surprised me was that I didn't use any notes during the test. I had prepared a lot of notes during my study sessions, but when it came time to take the test, I found that I didn't need to refer to them. This was a pleasant surprise because it showed me that I had a strong understanding of the material.

Overall, I'm proud of my score and pleased with my performance on the test. I know that I have some areas to work on, but I'm confident that with continued effort and practice, I can improve even further.
