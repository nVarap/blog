<p><strong>You are a school who wants to iterate over a bunch of student IDs (which are in the order such that if you added one, you would get the next student) to contact them, what variable name/data type would you use</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>ID, integer</li>
  <li>stuID, integer</li>
  <li>studentID, string</li>
  <li>IDofStudentNumber, integer</li>
</ol>

    1. ID is descriptive enough, especially if iterating. Also, if you are iterating it is inefficient to iterate over a string of multiple numbers, so adding would actually be the most efficient method.

<p><strong>You want to store the grade of you and your friend. What would you call your score and what datatype?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>score, integer</li>
  <li>My score, integer</li>
  <li>myScore, float</li>
  <li>myScore, integer</li>
</ol>

    3. Floats are the way to store decimal types, such as grades. myScore is a name that is descriptive enough, since you have to differ between two scores. 
</details>

<p><strong>You want store a name over a interation. What would you call your variable and what data type</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>name, string</li>
  <li>name, integer</li>
  <li>myName, string</li>
  <li>lmao_get_rekt, integer</li>
</ol>

    1. you want to store an arbitrary name, not a regular one, so you'll use a generic name. This is a name, so you'd use a string.
