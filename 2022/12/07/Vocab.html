<p>Section 5-7
I got a 0.9, and given I did all the work, I am quite proud of all the things that I did. I learned a lot about the subject at hand. I spent an amount of time I was proud of and believed my learning benefitted.</p>

<p>Section 8&amp;10: 
N/A, we taught this</p>

<p>Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms</p>

<p>Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles - Various ways of representing data.
Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point - Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs
Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off
Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) - lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data.</p>

<p>Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms -</p>

<p>Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators - Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables
Managing Complexity with Variables:  Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class
Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration - These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence 
Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables - ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND.
Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings - Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them.
Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements - Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true.
Python For, While loops with Range, with List - various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable.
Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it
Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values - Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output.</p>
