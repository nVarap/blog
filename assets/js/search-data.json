Advanced The @keyframes tag allows for us to store and recognize a set of keyframes. This is used in combination of the animation property. Fade class could be used to help run these animations as well. . Number Guessing Game It works by checking a number guessed in order to see if it is higher or lower, and then setting a text marker to be as such. Then, it will change color of the background depending on whether the answer is correct or incorrect . SASS makes this more appealing by adding color, so it isn’t just black-and-white .",

            "content": "Hack 1 . Pros of Duck DNS: . Its free, and allows you to access domain services that allow users to assign a domain name specific to their website. | Access a device using a specific host name. Convenient as opposed to a port or other host name | Can use HTTPS or other form of hashing algorithm in order to protect data | Domain names can be custom in order to make stuff more accessible | . Cons of Duck DNS: . Not suitable for larger projects, or maybe unable to be scaled. | Depends on the connection of the device to the domain service, no direct connection in a way like ethernet or other form of connection | . . Hacks 2 . We use a DNS in order to host our flask projects on a local server in order to make sure that those who are on the internet can access our flask pages. DuckDNS takes our flask and hosts it on a local server stored in a server room elsewhere int eh world, sharing our information from our device and our AWS container to that server which attaches our hosted version to a different port, under a different name, thus allowing it to be hosted. To setup using duck DNS, we have to (1) Sign in with your DuckDNS account by selecting “Sign in with Github” (2) Then create a subdomain using (3) Change the IP address to the one you would like to link to(4) Click the IP address button and link to your subdomain. . Hack 3 (Not doing) . Hack 4 . I do not currently have any confusions regarding deployment. I found the process rather intuitive, and really the commands to be the primary issues. Mainly outdated and conflicting dependencies as a result of there being numerous people on the same instance. Also, there are some issues with the number of internet connections that need to occur in order to reach,a dn there are also issues with the idea of PUSD internet interfering with the process. Many of the issues we see really do happen because there aren’t necessarily fixes we see online. These are extreme corner cases that we come upon by sheer coincidence. . Hack 5 . . Hacks 6 .

Virtual desktops and KASM (Kernel Adaptive Security Module) provide a secure environment to access data without compromising the host’s system. In an APCSP, we can use KASM to create a controlled environment with which students can contribute to code without suffering the consequences. Additionally, virtual desktops can be useful for facilitating collaboration among students and enabling remote instruction. VNCs could be used for cross-platform or long-distance collaboration, as we see with splashtop in the CTE department. . KASM Team Work . . AWS Database Quizzes . Quiz 1 . C | D | C | Quiz 2 .

OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of SSL/TLS protocols that is widely used for secure communication on the Internet. It offers a range of cryptographic features, including encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and hash functions. LibreSSL, on the other hand, is a fork of OpenSSL that was created in 2014 after the discovery of the Heartbleed vulnerability. In terms of security features, both OpenSSL and LibreSSL offer similar capabilities, such as support for strong cryptographic algorithms, certificate validation, and secure key management. In March 2021, OpenSSL released a security advisory that addressed three vulnerabilities, including a high-severity flaw that could allow an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack or execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. .",

Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point - Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) - lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms - . Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators - Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration - These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence . Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables - ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND. . Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings - Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them. . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements - Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true. . Python For, While loops with Range, with List - various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable. . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it . Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values - Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output. . Decidable problems: You can develop an algorithm for these problems, specifically yes or no . Undecidable problem: No algorithm can be used in order to provide a correct yes or no problems. . Problem: description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm Decision problem: A problem with a binary answer Algorithm: A series of ways to solve a problem. Process or a set of rules . 1, 2, 3, and 4 step | 1: Linear | 2: Exponential | 3: Square | 4: Factorial Superpolynomial: Offers an incredibly small amount of data incredibly large amounts of time. | . Simulation: Simulates a real-world experiment (abstraction of a complicated phenomena) . Removes unnecessary details | Level of abstraction depends on who/why we’re creating it | Ex: A flying simulator | . Documentation: The what, how, or why of the code Libraries: Prewritten code or procedures that can be used to maximize efficiency API: Data stored in a database that can be accessed via code . Random: A library in python to assist in pseudo-randomness . Method/Function/Procedure - A set of code that can be run as a package, that takes in parameters and returns a return value . Example: add(1, 2), which adds two numbers | Catch all terms for a set of code | . Parameter - Input values for procedures . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose . Parameter: are input values of a procedure ^ There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements (void) . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program .
