Matching up with the rubric . Program purpose and function The program has a clear purpose; a game of hangman | The program’s function is to receive an input as a letter and output a string of the letter informing the player on what letters they may have gotten correct | It takes input from the player in the form of a character and outputs the new string | The program functions wells and is consistent | . | Data Abstraction The program abstracts data into lists, i.e | . The list of words to choose from | The index list holding where the letters are correct | The list containing the correct and hidden word | . | Managing Complexity To manage repeatable or complex tasks, I grouped them into functions, i.e | . The function to check correctness | The function to check for the indexes at which letters are correct | The function to replace the letters at said indexes - These tasks repeat often in a game of hangman to condensing them into functions reduces the time needed to not only compile but to code. If this game were to expand it would also allows for reusable usage of these functions. | . | Procedural Abstraction The functions created are adaptable and have very little hard coding | In a different environment, these functions can adapts | The replace at function at replace different characters given a list | The returnWhere function can be used out of this context to find indices at which letters match up | . | Algorithm Implementation This program implements an accurate algorithm, which takes in input, checks said input, and outputs proper feedback | . Takes in a character | Loops over characters, finding indices | Replaces letters at said indices | Outputs new string - This algorithm continues until the program terminates or the player succeeds/fails | . | Testing Strenuous testing was undertaken with this program | Built to be consistent and resilient | All undertaken by me | . | Tips to improve: . Add comments | Code everything at once, then look at the rubric. | . Reflection on the article . Thanks to reading the article, I now know the proper procedure and tactics on how I can get a 5 on the APCSP exam in May. To be specific, I now know what tools are available, such as Khan Academy and where I can find practice tests. I now know what college board looks for when they grade projects. I now know to add comments more often, something that I can often neglect. As shown above, I’ve listed items I could improve upon to make sure I attain a 5. While I still have a way to go, I believe I am on the right track. .",

Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . Hacks 3.1: . Yes, using reverse indexing [-1]. -1 Accesses the back of the list . for i in range(len(InfoDb)): print(InfoDb[-(i+1)]) # -0 is still the first index print() . {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Chinmay&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;R&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 20&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;chinmay@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;Bugatti Chiron&#39;]} {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Varalu&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;N&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 15&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Jose&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;lcopebozo2@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;Lemon&#39;]} {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Sunny&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Naidu&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;August 2&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Temecula&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;snaidu@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;4Runner&#39;]} {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Mortensen&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;October 21&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;jmortensen@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;2015-Fusion&#39;, &#39;2011-Ranger&#39;, &#39;2003-Excursion&#39;, &#39;1997-F350&#39;, &#39;1969-Cadillac&#39;]} . Hacks 3.2 . Yes, there are a myriad of different list methods, i.e . pop | remove | sorted | sort | count | extend | reverse, etc. | . lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6] lst.append(7) print(lst) lst.pop() print(lst) lst.remove(3) print(lst) lst.insert(3, 212) print(lst) lst.clear() print(lst) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] [1, 2, 4, 212, 5, 6] [] . Hacks 3.3 . You can add and create new keys to a dictionary using input, by assigning keys using: . dictkey[keyname] = key | . dictionary = {} keyname = input(&quot;keyname&quot;) keyval = input(&quot;keyval&quot;) dictionary[keyname] = keyval print(dictionary) . {&#39;sy&#39;: &#39;2&#39;} . Hacks 3.4 . My previous quiz utilized dictionaries to store questions and answers. It would be easier to just use a dictionary, but one can use a list of dictionaries to store question/answers . import json from xml.dom import UserDataHandler def returnListFrom(): f = open(&quot;info.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) string = json.loads(f.read()) f.close() return string def getEmail(user, lst): for dict in lst: if dict[&quot;Name&quot;] == user: return dict[&quot;Email&quot;] def checkForConsistency(user, password, lst): for dict in lst: if dict[&quot;Name&quot;] == user and dict[&quot;password&quot;] == password: return True return False def addDictionaryToFile(dictionary): string = returnListFrom() string.append(dictionary) with open(&quot;info.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;) as f: f.write(json.dumps(string)) place = input(&quot;Input new info or sign in? [type info or sign]&quot;) if place.lower() == &#39;info&#39;: print(&quot;Welcome info placement, place you information when prompted and it will be added to database&quot;) name = input(&quot;Input name value: &quot;) email = input(&quot;Input email value: &quot;) password = input(&quot;Input password value &quot;) dictionary = { &quot;Name&quot; : name, &#39;Email&#39;: email, &#39;password&#39; : password } addDictionaryToFile(dictionary) print(f&quot;Added {name}, n {email}, n {password}&quot;) elif place.lower() == &quot;sign&quot;: biglst = returnListFrom() print(&quot;When prompted enter in sign in info&quot;) user = input(&quot;Enter username: &quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter password: &quot;) useremail = getEmail(user, biglst) if checkForConsistency(user, password, biglst): print(&quot;Signed in!&quot;) print(f&quot;Credentials: {user}, {password}&quot;) print(f&quot;Email: {useremail}&quot;) else: &quot;user password either not exist or bad input.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
