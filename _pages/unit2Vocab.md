nit 2… Binary/Data Terms

Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data.
Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point - Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs
Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off
Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) - lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data.

Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms - 

Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators - Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables


Managing Complexity with Variables:  Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class
Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration - These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence 

Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables - ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND.

Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings - Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them.

Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements - Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn't true, and else checks if nothing above ois true.

Python For, While loops with Range, with List - various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable.

Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it

Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values - Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output.

Decidable problems: You can develop an algorithm for these problems, specifically yes or no

Undecidable problem: No algorithm can be used in order to provide a correct yes or no problems. 

Problem: description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm
Decision problem: A problem with a binary answer
Algorithm: A series of ways to solve a problem. Process or a set of rules
  - 1, 2, 3, and 4 step
  - 1: Linear
  - 2: Exponential
  - 3: Square
  - 4: Factorial
Superpolynomial: Offers an incredibly small amount of data incredibly large amounts of time.

Simulation: Simulates a real-world experiment (abstraction of a complicated phenomena)
  - Removes unnecessary details
  - Level of abstraction depends on who/why we're creating it
  - Ex: A flying simulator

Documentation: The what, how, or why of the code
Libraries: Prewritten code or procedures that can be used to maximize efficiency
API: Data stored in a database that can be accessed via code

Random: A library in python to assist in pseudo-randomness

Method/Function/Procedure - A set of code that can be run as a package, that takes in parameters and returns a return value
  - Example: add(1, 2), which adds two numbers
  - Catch all terms for a set of code

Parameter - Input values for procedures

Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose

Parameter: are input values of a procedure
^ There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements (`void`)

Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program

Binary Search: An algorithm to search methodically for an item in a sorted list

Algorithms: Steps in order repeated or run through to accomplish a task
