## Week 1
- Started work on Fastpages Frontend Development
    - Learned how to change tags configure when assigning tags in the TOC. Changing these tags add them
    - Create new pages, using TOC and making the `.md` file's layout to page 
- Learn bash
    - Use basic syntax, such as assigning variables without spaces `str="string"`
    - Use `echo` to print
- Learn basic python
    - Use `print` and  
    - `return` to output

## Week 2
- Started learning about python dictionaries
    - Create lists using `[]` and dictionaries using `{}`
    - use `append` to add to the end of a list
    - You can **nest** lists and dictionaries, which means to put multiple of a similar structure in one
    - You can print out a list and dictionary, or print out an **index** (an element or object in a list)
    - You can use a `for i in range(x)` loop, a `for element in list`, `while i != x` or a recursive loop (using a function that calls itself)
