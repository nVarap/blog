      <td>0. This list given is not described, and we don’t know what the list contributes to the code overall</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Managing Complexity</td>
      <td>0. Does not display how complexity is managed. Does not display how complexity is shown. No code segment is shown either</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
      <td>0. does not describe how the program uses it and how it improves functionality.</td>

      <td>1. Correctly displays running the code and how the algorithm is implemented</td>
      <td>1. Correctly displays running</td>

<p><strong>Reflect</strong>: I found this to be the first truly <em>bad</em> example of what not to do. I’d probably have to take more time to write the performance task and ensure that I am as detailed as possible. If possible, maybe use language of the prompt?</p>

<p><strong>Reflect</strong>: This is an awesome, student-made example. Something like this (as the program states) builds creativity within me.</p>
