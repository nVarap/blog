<p>Our Agile Manifesto lines out what we believe are the key parts of our team. Just for context, let us lay out our team dynamic again</p>

<p>We found it necessary to <em>be serious</em> when deciding what to use in our agile manifesto, so we chose to do high quality work and to be adaptable and dependable. We find high quality work important because our work reflects on us, and we’d like to be perceived as a group that can accomplish things, especially because we are almost all STEM-oriented. We found Adaptability to be useful because from Robotics we know that things <strong>never</strong> go the way one expects, and this can result in bad things happening if we remain stubborn. We also know that it isn’t good to simply rely on one person to do all the work, just because we don’t know, so we implemented dependence.</p>

<p>We also added open-mindedness and innovate to the manifesto because we want to achieve great things, and to do this we must be oriented towards looking off the beaten path and try to innovate our own ideas.</p>

<p>At the very bottom, we also added to do this while having fun. We bolded “fun” because having fun is still an important thing during work. W/o fun there is no passion in your work, and without passion the rest of our manifesto becomes kaput. Therefore, we wanted a reminder that these are all interdependent on our passion towards the project, and to always keep that passion towards our work.</p>
