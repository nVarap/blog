<h1 id="college-board-score">
<a class="anchor" href="#college-board-score" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>College board Score</h1>

<p>I got a 46/50. I very well could have gotten a 48/50 if I looked through the questions a bit better, but overall I am okay with my score. I feel that many of my issues were as a result of not understanding the situation of a full word. As a result, reading more into certain problems would greatly help.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem 1</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/images/mcqscore1.png" alt="" title="1">
<strong>Correct answer</strong>: B and C.</p>

<p><em>Why I got it wrong</em>: I did not understand the full context of the situation, and as a result was unable to determine that in fact C was the correct answer. In order to fix this, I should have more consciousness when looking over answers again. By looking over this answer again, I would have been able to get it correct, most likely.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem 2</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/images/mcqscore2.png" alt="" title="1"></p>

<p><strong>Correct answer</strong>: B</p>

<p><em>Why I got it wrong</em>: I feel the situation confused me, and as a result, I was not able to interpret the answers correctly. I feel I just need to slow down (as I was taking a bit of a rush in order to finish it) I could have gotten it correct.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem 3</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/images/mcqscore3.png" alt="" title="1"></p>

<p><strong>Correct answer</strong>: C</p>

<p><em>Why I got it wrong</em>: I was incorrect in my judgement pertaining to the algorithms. I was overall skeptical about the second algorithm because it felt like it wasn’t going to work. However, I now see that I should have trusted my first gut instinct, and gone with that</p>

<h2 id="problem-4">
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-4" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem 4</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/images/mcqscore4.png" alt="" title="1"></p>

<p><strong>Correct answer</strong>: C</p>

<p><em>Why I got it wrong</em>: I did not know what the work <mark>heuristic</mark> meant, and as a result I feel that as a result I was unable to fully judge what it meant. I was able to get the first question right, but this one not so much. After the quiz, I searched up what heuristic meant (because I wanted ot complete the quiz without searching something up), and found out my error. If I knew what the word meant, I probably would have been able to get it correct</p>

<h1 id="final-reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#final-reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Reflection:</h1>
<p>I like how I did on this project. I feel that I could have done better if I paid attention to what I was working. What I feel like I could do in the future is pay attention to the stuff I am working on, and as result I would probably improve. In the future, I will definitely also go over what I am working on.</p>
