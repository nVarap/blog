  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>9 &amp; 11</td>
      <td>0.9, as I did all was asked and no extras, I deserved this score. I probably should have done extras for this though, event though I did code the actual algorithm I understand how that isn’t extra</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13.2-13.3</td>
      <td>1.0, as I finished all that was asked for and created my own robot course, goal, and way to get through it using procedural abstraction. I’m happy with my score.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.14 - 3.15</td>
      <td>1.0, as I finished everything + attempting the extra credit, which I actually found very fun and interesting.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Overall reflection : I’m happy with my scores, but I’m going to start moving towards actually doing extra in order to get 1.0s for not only these assignments but future ones.</p>
