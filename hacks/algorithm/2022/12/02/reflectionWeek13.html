<p>Reflection:
I felt I may have deserved a full score, however I understand how my score may have been lowered. I’m pretty sure that I completed every task however I am not one to doubt the graders. I guess I mainly need to look to finish up each section while keeping an eye on what I have and have not done. For our presentation and homework, I’d ensure that we have checks to make sure that people completed the sections, and categorize hacks in more concise sections to ensure that people would be able to check what they have and haven’t done without missing anything.</p>
