  <li>Our project was Kernel, and our team was almost the second presentation for Mr.Yeung’s class. We were basically a quizlet-esque program.</li>
  <li>At the actual event, our AWS died literally beforehand, and we were unable to get it to work as a result (due to an exit code 3)</li>
  <li>With hindsight, it was due to a problem in the code so the AWS interpreter couldn’t compile it. Good to note in future cases that an exit code of 3 means there is an error in the source code</li>
  <li>Our presentation went well, I feel.</li>

<ul>
  <li>I liked seeing 3D animation stuff, because I was in the class last year and found it interesting. Mainly I liked the model of a person someone did.</li>
  <li>I really liked ceramics, especially because they had a ceramic fruit from <em>One Piece</em>, and anime I really like</li>
  <li>For CSP, I saw the lawnmowers, who created multiple games on fastpages.</li>
